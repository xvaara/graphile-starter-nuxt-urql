# Postgraphile Nuxt Starter

For information about Nuxt look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

Original [Graphile starter](https://github.com/graphile/starter) is build using Next.js and express. This is a fork to use Nuxt, Nuxt UI and URQL.
## NOT FOR BEGINNERS

We do not advise that you build your own projects on top of this project until
you're comfortable with the various tools it uses
([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/),
[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com),
[Nuxt Ui](https://ui.nuxt.com),
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html),
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/),
[PostGraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/introduction/),
[Graphile Worker](https://github.com/graphile/worker),
[Graphile Migrate](https://github.com/graphile/migrate),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/),
[URQL](https://nearform.com/open-source/urql/),
[GraphQL Code Generator](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator),
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/), etc.)

This is an **advanced** project with deeply integrated tooling across the full
stack. The project is called "Starter" because it helps you to start new
projects with all these technologies, tools and techniques already in place. If
you're not already familiar with these things then you'll probably find the
project overwhelming, it is not intended to be your first experience of any of
these tools.

If you're just getting started with PostGraphile, before you dive into this
project make sure you check out the
[PostGraphile required knowledge](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/required-knowledge/)
and especially the
[schema design tutorial](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/postgresql-schema-design/).
This repository takes a slightly different approach to schema design than the
aforementioned tutorial, but it's still an incredibly valuable resource.

## Status

This starter uses the beta version of Graphile, is missing some features, no working tests and the components are created with AI agent converting from the original next.js ones and then fixed to work correctly.

Use at your own risk. Probably not ready for production.

## Usage

Setup env, database and start the dev server

```bash
npm run setup
npm run dev
```
